I’ve seen how deeply it hurts when someone you love looks at you - and doesn’t remember who you are. I’ve seen it in the eyes of people close to me, when their parent or grandparent forgets a name, a face, or a lifetime of shared moments. It’s heartbreaking.

And the truth is, the older we get, the closer this reality feels. Personally, I’m afraid of one day becoming part of the more than 57 million people living with dementia, a number that increases evey year. 

That’s why I started working on an AI-powered memory companion designed especially for people in the early stages of dementia - so they can shape it alongside their loved ones, and grow with it as their condition progresses. Because we all deserve to hold on to what matters.

Kokoro is a smart app that learns from what matters most - stories, names, photos, memories, and routines - shared by both the patient and their caregivers.

It’s designed to preserve identity, protect connection, and gently support people and families living with dementia.

Here’s how it works:

- The user can take or upload a photo of someone they don’t recognize. Kokoro gently responds with a short phrase like *'This is Catarina, your granddaughter. You had lunch together last Friday.'*
- The **Memory Hub** stores their most treasured life moments - and relates it to the people involved, which you can see in the **Loved Ones Section.**
- A smart **calendar** offers reminders: *'Take your medication at 10 AM… Dinner with João at 12:30'*
- And science-proven **memory games**, to slow down the memory loss.

Kokoro runs on a freemium model - because connection shouldn’t be a privilege. The app is fully functional and free, with a small fee for adding extra caregivers, in the  B to C system.

For care providers like nursing homes (B to B), Eloa offers an integrated system: patient profiles are seamlessly synced, staff photos and names are added automatically,  to make every face familiar.

And this touches us all. Dementia will touch nearly every family - and the earlier we act, the more dignity we preserve. With Kokoro, we give people the power to remember, while they still can - and the comfort of being remembered, when they no longer can."
